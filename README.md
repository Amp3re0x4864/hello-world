# hello-world
Just a start for a long journey.

Hi Humans and Robots of the future!

Harshdeep, aka HD, here, I like coding in C++, Python and C#.
I study Autonomous Systems at KTH Royal Institue of Technology.
I love to explore caf√©s.
I also don't shed a single tear while chopping even hundreds of onions (I'm serious!!)
